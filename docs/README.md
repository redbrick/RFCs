# Redbrick RFCs

A Request for Comments (RFC) is a type of publication from the technology community. RFCs may come from many bodies including from Redbrick Admins, Committee or Members.

An RFC is authored in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Society and Society-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor.

## How to submit RFC

2. Fork this repo and add your edits

3. Then [sumbit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) when you have fully finished your RFC
